# Overview of the Project

The goal of this project is to help Louise who, has a theaterical production, research crowdfunding data with respect to their launch dates and funding goals. Our objective is to provide Louise with an indept analysis and visual charts to help her succed in her goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

The data used for this research was collected from worldwide crowdfunding projects spanning the time frame 2010-2017. This comprised of 4114 crowdfunding projects. Our analysis was mostly restricted to a particular category (Theaters) and a subcategory (Plays) within as this would be most interesting to Louise.

### Challenges

For both the analysis the only major challenge was my unfamiliarity with excel functions. For the first analysis generating pivot tables and charts was fairly straight forward. One issue that I face was when filtered using the newly created "Years" column. I would not see months and I had to use the "Date ended conversion" column instead.

For the second analysis, my only complain would be typing the Goals column. I am sure that one could write a script to fill in this column, especially if there were more entries in this column than the 12 listed.
