# Overview of the Project

The goal of this project is to help Louise who, has a theaterical production, research crowdfunding data with respect to their launch dates and funding goals. Our objective is to provide Louise with an indept analysis and visual charts to help her succed in her goals.

## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis

The data used for this research was collected from worldwide crowdfunding projects spanning the time frame 2010-2017. This comprised of 4114 crowdfunding projects. Our analysis was mostly restricted to a particular category (Theaters) and a subcategory (Plays) within as this would be most interesting to Louise.

### Challenges

For both the analysis the only major challenge was my unfamiliarity with excel functions. For the first analysis generating pivot tables and charts was fairly straight forward. One issue that I face was when filtered using the newly created "Years" column. I would not see months and I had to use the "Date ended conversion" column instead as it breaks down into quaters and months.

For the second analysis, my only complain would be typing the Goals column. I am sure that one could write a script to fill in this column, especially if there were more entries in this column than the 12 listed.

## Result

### Theater Outcome Based on Launch Date

The two conclusions that can be drawn from this analysis are;
1. Months May-July are most favorable to start a crowdfunding project. The success to fail ratio for these three months are quite similar (65%+/-2) and eventhough May would look the better month June would be not a distant second choice.
2. Setting up a crowdfunding project should be avoided in the month of December as there's a equal chance that it may fail. 

### Outcome Based on Goals

The clear conclusion here is not to set a crowdfunding goal between $45,000-$49,999 as it has a 100% chance of failure. 

## Limitation

1. One limitation is that this data is not current and relies on information collected between 2010-2017. To get a more realistic picture data generate from 2015-current should be considered.
